In this project I demonstrate ProjectEuler.net solutions using q. All solutions are compiled in ProjectEuler.ipynb, and are also saved in as individual .q files in the Solutions folder.

Many solutions will run without any dependencies, however some require first loading utils.q. This is done seamlessly if you set the path for $NOAHGITPE to the ProjectEuler folder (with "/" at the end.) For example I have the following in my .zprofile:

export NOAHGITPE="/Users/noahattrup/git/ProjectEuler/"
